# GEMA
"The Study Group for Programming Marathons (GEMA) is an extension group of the ICMC (Institute of Mathematical and Computer Sciences), based at USP SÃ£o Carlos, which trains for the main competitive programming competitions in the country, in the style of the SBC Programming Marathon." -- @icmcgema on GitHub

Why keep this? Why not?! Better than nothing!

I have had my fair share of competitive programming before college, but lost interest after placing 200th on the Brazillian Olympiad of Informatics (OBI) nationals in 2019 (not a brag, I just really sucked). Once I joined USP, I took a look at competitive programming again, but quickly lost interest again after realizing that there were other study groups more interesting than studying tons of algorithms. I now want to get into Cybersecurity rather than competitive programming!
